📝 TASK 5.3: MOCK REPLAY MODE PLAN
=====================================

OBJECTIVE:
Create a prototype "replay mode" that simulates playing back test logs of sensor and vision data for debugging and evaluation using mock data and print statements.

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
Instead of real logging infrastructure, use mock data and print statements to demonstrate the replay concept quickly.

PHASE 1: Mock Test Session Data
--------------------------------
• Create MockTestSession struct with hardcoded test data
• Define MockTestEvent with timestamp, event type, and data
• Pre-populate 3 mock sessions:
  - "Morning Walk Test" (5 sensor events, 3 vision detections)
  - "Indoor Navigation" (8 sensor events, 4 vision detections)
  - "Outdoor Obstacle Course" (12 sensor events, 6 vision detections)

PHASE 2: Mock Logging in WarningTestView
----------------------------------------
• Add print statements for all events:
  - "📝 LOG: Sensor signal received - [signal] at [timestamp]"
  - "📝 LOG: Camera captured image at [timestamp]"
  - "📝 LOG: Vision classified as [result] with [confidence]% at [timestamp]"
  - "📝 LOG: Warning generated - [warning] at [timestamp]"
• Add session start/stop buttons (print only, no real logging)
• Console output shows all "logged" events in real-time

PHASE 3: Mock Replay Mode View
-------------------------------
• Create new MockReplayView SwiftUI component
• Display list of mock test sessions
• Show session metadata (name, event count, timestamp)
• Select session to "replay"
• Print replay events to console one by one

PHASE 4: Mock Replay Controls
------------------------------
• Play button: Start replaying events
• Progress bar: Show replay timeline
• Event display: Show current event being replayed
• Speed control: Adjust delay between events (0.5s, 1s, 2s)
• Print statements simulate event replay

MOCK DATA STRUCTURE:
-------------------
struct MockTestSession {
    let id: UUID
    let sessionName: String
    let startTime: Date
    let eventCount: Int
    let events: [MockTestEvent]
}

struct MockTestEvent {
    let timestamp: Date
    let eventType: String  // "SENSOR", "VISION", "WARNING"
    let data: String
}

BENEFITS:
---------
✅ Fast implementation (no complex storage)
✅ Easy testing via Xcode console
✅ Demonstrates replay concept
✅ No storage/performance issues
✅ Can be upgraded to real logging later

USER WORKFLOW:
--------------
1. Test: Use WarningTestView normally, see print statements
2. Browse: Go to MockReplayView, see mock sessions
3. Replay: Select session, watch events "replay"
4. Verify: Console shows all replay events with timing

FILES TO CREATE:
----------------
• MockReplayView.swift - Replay UI with session list
• MockTestSession.swift - Mock data models
• (Optional) TestSessionLogger.swift - Print statement wrapper

INTEGRATION:
------------
• Add MockReplayView to MainTabView or WarningTestView
• Link from Settings or Object Detection tab
• Minimal changes to existing code

STATUS: PLANNING COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
DUE DATE: 09/28/2025
