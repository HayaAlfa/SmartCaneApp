The iOS app now supports TWO connection types:

1. ESP32 SmartCane (Michelle's hardware):
   - Service UUID: 34123456-1234-1234-1234-123456789AAB
   - Characteristic UUID: 34123456-1234-1234-1234-123456789AAC
   - Message format: JSON {"cm":17.4,"ir":1,"alert":1,"buzz":1,"mot":70}
   - Device name: "SmartCane"

2. nRF Connect App (for testing):
   - Service UUID: 6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E
   - TX Characteristic: 6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E
   - RX Characteristic: 6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E
   - Message format: "F:20", "L:20", "R:20", "B:20"
   - Example: "F:20" for front obstacle at 20cm

Testing with nRF Connect:
1. Install nRF Connect app on Android device
2. Configure with Nordic UART Service UUIDs above
3. Connect iPhone to MacBook via USB
4. Run SmartCane app from Xcode
5. Send messages like "F:20", "L:30" from Android
6. Watch Xcode console for printed messages

Testing with ESP32:
1. Flash Michelle's code to ESP32
2. Power on ESP32
3. Open SmartCane app on iPhone
4. Connect to "SmartCane" device in Settings
5. ESP32 sends JSON automatically when obstacles detected
6. Watch Xcode console for messages
